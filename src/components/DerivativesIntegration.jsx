          <h3>Risk Hedging:</h3>
          <p className="lead">
            Derivatives allow you to hedge against potential risks in your investment portfolio. By using derivative contracts such as options and futures, you can protect your investments from adverse price movements.
          </p>
          <h3>Portfolio Diversification:</h3>
          <p className="lead">
            Derivatives offer an avenue for portfolio diversification by providing exposure to various asset classes and markets. You can invest in derivatives linked to commodities, currencies, interest rates, and stock indices.
          </p>
          <h3>Leverage and Amplified Returns:</h3>
          <p className="lead">
            Derivatives allow you to amplify your potential returns through leverage. By using margin and derivatives contracts, you can control a larger position in an asset than what you would be able to with your available capital alone.
          </p>
          <h3>Sophisticated Investment Strategies:</h3>
          <p className="lead">
            Derivatives provide a platform for implementing complex investment strategies. For instance, you can employ options strategies such as straddles, spreads, and collars to take advantage of specific market conditions or expectations.
          </p>
          <h3>Efficient Price Discovery:</h3>
          <p className="lead">
            Derivatives contribute to efficient price discovery in the market. The continuous trading and pricing of derivatives contracts provide valuable information about market expectations and sentiment.
          </p>
          <h3>Risk Management for Businesses:</h3>
          <p className="lead">
            Derivatives are not limited to individual investors; they also play a crucial role in risk management for businesses. Companies can utilize derivatives to mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, and commodity price volatility.
